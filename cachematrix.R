## This is a function that cache the inverse of a matrix.
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This is a function to inverse the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix in 1.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
